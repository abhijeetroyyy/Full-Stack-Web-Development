    <!-- SEO  -->
    <h1>SEO</h1>
    <p>1.SEO is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from
        search engines through unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results). It involves considering how
        search engines work, the algorithms that dictate search engine behavior, and the actual search terms or keywords
        typed into search engines. The goal is to rank higher on the search engine results page (SERP) to increase
        visibility and potential conversion of visitors into customers. SEO has been around since the mid-1990s and has
        evolved as search engines have become more sophisticated in their ranking algorithms to prevent webmasters from
        manipulating rankings..</p>

    <!-- CLS  -->
    <H1>CLS</H1>
    <p>
        Cumulative Layout Shift(CLS) is a Core Web Vitals metric defined by Google that measures the visual stability of
        web pages. It is an important factor in SEO as it evaluates the quality of user experience (UX) by quantifying
        the amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during the loading of a web page. A large portion of HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, and other resources can be loaded after the content in the initial view has been fully
        displayed in the web browser. CLS ensures that what is loaded later does not alter the page in a way that
        impairs UX when visitors start to browse the page. A good CLS score is vital to search engine optimization as it
        is part of Google's algorithmic ranking system for SERPs. Google considers a “good” CLS score to be less than
        0.1 for PageSpeed rankings. 10Web Booster is one of the best solutions to automate obtaining good CLS scores for
        a wide range of WordPress websites.</p>
    <!-- FID  -->
    <h1>FID</h1>
    <P>FID, or First Input Delay, is a metric used to measure the time takes for a website to respond to a's first
        interaction loading the page. This interaction can be a click, tap, or use of a custom JavaScript-powered
        control. FID is an important measurement of a website's user experience, as a longer delay can lead to a poor
        user experience and a higher likelihood of users leaving the site. A good FID score is 100 milliseconds or less,
        while a score between 100 and 300 milliseconds has room for improvement. A score above 300 milliseconds is
        considered poor. FID can be measured using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights or the Chrome User Experience
        Report. To improve FID, it is recommended to optimize and minify code, remove or delay unused third-party
        scripts, and break up long JavaScript tasks into smaller, asynchronous tasks.</P>
